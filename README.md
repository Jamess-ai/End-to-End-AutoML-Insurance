# End-to-End AutoML with H2O, MLflow, FastAPI, and Streamlit for Life Insurance Risk Assessment 

Link to writeup: *Coming Soon*

## Context
- Traditional machine learning (ML) model development is time-consuming, resource-intensive, and requires a high degree of technical expertise along with many lines of code.Â 
- This model development process has been simplified and accelerated with the advent of automated machine learning (AutoML), allowing data teams to generate performant and scalable models quickly and efficiently.
- An important thing to remember is that there are multiple components in production-ready ML systems beyond model development.
- In this project, we explore how to set up, train, and serve an ML system using the powerful capabilities of H2O AutoML, MLflow, FastAPI, and Streamlit for life insurance risk assessment.


___
## Objective
- Build a predictive ML pipeline (on Prudential Life Insurance data) to automatically classify customer risk so that insurers can make the application process more streamlined.

___
## Pipeline Components
- Data Acquisition and Preprocessing
- H2O AutoML training with MLflow tracking
- Deployment of best H2O model via FastAPI
- Streamlit user interface to post test data to FastAPI endpoint
